# MachineLearning_Crossover

### Date: Jul 16 2020

I am a graduate student who is interested in Machine Learning.    
The purpose of this repo is to share my understandings of basic machine learning topics.
In my notes,
- some concepts could be wrong or unclear, please let me know
- some algorithms may have better implementations, please let me know
- some concept may not show up right on GitHub, try use: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
- may be more?

Anyway, thanks for spending time on my note, :)
